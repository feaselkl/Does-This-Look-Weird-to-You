# Does This Look Weird to You?  An Introduction to Anomaly Detection

This repository provides the supporting code for my presentation entitled [Does This Look Weird to You?  An Introduction to Anomaly Detection](https://www.catallaxyservices.com/presentations/does-this-look-weird-to-you/).

## Running the Code

In order to run this code, you will need .NET 5 installed on your machine.  In order to run the `AzureAnomalyDetection` project, you will need to set environment variables named `ANOMALY_DETECTOR_KEY` AND `ANOMALY_DETECTOR_ENDPOINT` before running this.
